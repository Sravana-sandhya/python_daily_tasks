# Q11. Payment System (Runtime Polymorphism) An online store supports multiple payment methods: CreditCard, UPI, and NetBanking. Create a base class Payment with a method process_payment() and override it in each payment type.
class Payment:
    def process_payment(self):
        print("Processing Payment")
class CreditCard(Payment):
    def process_payment(self):
       print("Payment done using Credit Card")
class UPI(Payment):
    def process_payment(self):
        print("Payment done using UPI")
class NetBanking(Payment):
    def process_payment(self):
        print("Payment done using Net Banking")
c = CreditCard()
u = UPI()
n = NetBanking()
c.process_payment()
u.process_payment()
n.process_payment()
